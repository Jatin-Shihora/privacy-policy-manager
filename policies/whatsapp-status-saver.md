## How the App Works

1. When you view a status in WhatsApp, WhatsApp caches it locally on your device
2. Our App reads these locally cached files from your device storage
3. When you tap "Save," we copy the file to your Pictures folder
4. **No data ever leaves your device** - everything happens locally

## Advertising

WhatsApp Status Saver is a free, ad-supported application. We use Google AdMob to display advertisements.

### What AdMob May Collect
- Device advertising identifier (Advertising ID)
- IP address
- Device information (model, operating system version)
- Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)

### More Information

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
All your data is stored locally on your device:
- Viewed status thumbnails
- Saved status files (in Pictures/StatusSaver folder)
- App preferences and settings
- Folder access permissions

### No Cloud Sync
We do not offer cloud synchronization. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly:
- Share a status using Android's share feature
- The App loads advertisements (which requires internet)

### Data Deletion
Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Uninstalling the App removes all App-related data
- You can clear App data anytime via Android Settings
- Saved status files remain in your Pictures folder until you delete them
